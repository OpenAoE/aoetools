Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the aoetools.  The best
way to submit proposed changes is in plain-text "patches".  These
patches are generated by the diff program.

Patches should be clean (to the point and easy to read) and should do
one thing.  Send multiple patches if necessary.  Patches should be
generated with "diff -uprN" if possible, and should be designed to be
applied with "patch -p1".


Design note:

The aoe-mkdevs and aoe-mkshelf scripts are expected to work with
special device files forever, but the aoe-discover script will likely
someday use sysfs or something similar instead of
/dev/etherd/discover.  The same goes for aoe-interfaces.  For that
reason, there is no runtime interface for giving aoe-discover an
alternative to /dev/etherd at runtime.  Instead, the device directory
is set once and for all by make.  That way, the user interface won't
change or become obsolete when aoe-discover stops using
/dev/etherd/discover.
