The aoetools are programs that assist in using ATA over Ethernet on
systems with version 2.6 and newer Linux kernels.  

Systems running 2.4 Linux kernels do not need and should not install
the aoetools.  The aoe driver for 2.4 kernels is self sufficient.

Please see the aoetools manpage for a brief list of the tools.

AOE DRIVER COMPATIBILITY

  If you are using udev on your system, the aoe-mkdevs and aoe-mkshelf
  should not be used.  Just let udev create device nodes for you.  If
  you need to configure udev, its manpages, in conjunction with the
  example in the EtherDrive HOWTO FAQ, should help.

  If you are not using udev, it is important to ensure that the device
  nodes in /dev/etherd match the aoe driver.  Please see devnodes.txt
  for information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING THE AOETOOLS

If you need to configure the software, look at the variables at the
top of the Makefile.  The defaults should work for most people.  When
using the defaults there's only one step to configure and install the
aoetools software and documentation:

  make install

You'll need sufficient permissions to install in the default locations
if you haven't overridden them with your own locations.

The aoe-sancheck tool depends on libpthread.  If its header and
library files are not present, the aoetools makefile skips
aoe-sancheck.  You can install your Linux distribution's "libpthread"
and "libpthread-devel" packages (They might be called something
slightly different) to help aoe-sancheck to build successfully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
LEGACY TOOLS

These two are legacy commands for systems without udev.

  aoe-mkdevs		create character and block device files
  aoe-mkshelf		create block device files for one shelf address
