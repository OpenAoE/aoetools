.TH aoe-mkshelf 8
.SH NAME
aoe-mkshelf \- create special device files for one shelf address
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B aoe-mkshelf {device-dir} {shelf-address}
.B env n_partitions=1 aoe-mkshelf {device-dir} {shelf-address}
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I aoe-mkshelf
command is not needed on systems that have udev installed and 
is incompatible with aoe drivers that have the \fIaoe_dyndevs\fP
module parameter set to 1.
.PP
Systems lacking udev and having an aoe driver that uses static minor
device numbers can use \fIaoe-mkshelf\fP to create the block special
files necessary to access the AoE devices with the given shelf
address.
.PP
All aoe drivers prior to \fIaoe6-50\fP use static minor device
numbers.  Versions 50 and up use dynamic minor device numbers
when the module parameter aoe_dyndevs=1 is set.
.PP
If you are using static minor device numbers and your aoe driver
supports only one partition per device (whole-disk 
partitions), then the device files must match, and you should use the 
.I n_partitions
environment variable described below.
.SS Arguments
.TP
\fBdevice-dir\fP
This should be the name of the directory where the block device files
will be created.
.TP
\fBshelf-address\fP
This is the AoE major address, or shelf address, for which to create
device nodes.  For example, specifying a shelf address of 1 means that
the e1.* device nodes will be created in \fBdevice-dir\fP.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
If the
.I n_partitions
variable is set in the environment, it will override the default
number of partitions per aoe disk, namely 16.
.SH EXAMPLE
In this example, the root user on a host named
.I nai
creates special files for using the aoe disks in shelf 7.  Then he
remembers that the driver doesn't have partition support, so the
command is called again with \fIn_partitions\fP set to 1.
